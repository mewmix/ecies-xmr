# ecies-xmr

## Intro

This is a proof of concept for performing ECIES - Edwards Curve 25519 operations to derive a symmetric key from two parties key pairings. 

Heavily inspired by [ecies-py](https://github.com/ecies/py)

The Edwards25519 code was lifted from Jacken Baer's awesome repo [here](https://github.com/jackenbaer/monero)

All credit to his work and the ecies-py teams for providing a framework for me to build against.
